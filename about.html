                <p>
                    Born on December 8, 1992, in Stockholm (Sweden), Gabriel is best known for his soul and R&B inspired
                    sound. Gabriel gained fame attending the thirteenth season of the popular Swedish Idol competition
                    in 2017, in which he placed third overall. Since his departure from the program, Gabriel has
                    garnered a vast following of fans and has since been releasing music with his label, Loco Diablo
                    Productions.

                <p> Gabriels's father originates from the Latin-American country of Uruguay and Gabriels mother
                    originates from Sweden. Even though his upbringing was solely in Sweden he lets his heritage shine
                    through in his music and style.
                    <br><br>
                    Gabriel comes from a family of musicians and grew up with recurrent guitar jam-parties around the
                    dinner table with his grandfather, father, and uncles. His grandfather was a tango-singer from
                    Uruguay and his dad had a salsa band in his younger days. Even though their musical careers had
                    ended long ago, the music never stopped in the Cancela household.

                <p>From singing and writing music in his childhood room to 3rd place in Swedish idol to finally starting
                    his own record label with his younger brother, Lu Ziano, who is Gabriel’s producer and a
                    well-recognized rapper on his own. Gabriel is finally taking his own steps onto the music-scene.
